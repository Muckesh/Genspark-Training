Availability - high availability -> low downtime
	Min downtime
	Replication or redundancy -> replicating the main server and making it read only
	Auto recovery

Non - Available
	crash - auto recovery
	network failure - replication
	hardware failure - replication
	maintenance time - min downtime

Master and slave
Master - primary server
slave - standby (used for load balancing)

Master crashes / network failure or hardware failure - slave takes over (promotion)
Huge traffic - we can use the slave as side along master - load balancing

repmgr - replication manager - node manager for failover

PgBouncer - connection pooling

Pgpool - load balancing + connection pooling

streaming rep -> WAL - write ahead log -> rep is read only -> physical form
logical rep -> table level - publisher/subscriber pub/sub model
